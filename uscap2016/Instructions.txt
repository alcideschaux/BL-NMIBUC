- categorizing patients per initial bx and see if the class changes over time on serial biopsies. 
- Any association with PDL expression or FOXP3 status.  We can do that in the entire dataset  (since we have longitudinal x’s per patient we can consider each bx an event ?). 
- We can also analyze the relationship of the three groups below to Grade (LG, HG, CIS) and stage (pTis, pTa, pT1). We can do that in the entire dataset  (since we have longitudinal x’s per patient we can consider each bx an event ?). 
- Then we can also look for any correlation of initial Bx class to recurrence , to  grade progression and to stage progression 

GJ NETTO:
If you find doing the individual markers to be too much, One simple way we can classify of basal vs luminal (at least for the abstract) is put the cases in three bins based on the average extent of expression per case of a marker:
- CK5/6 avg ext and CD44 avg ext > CK20 avg ext and Gata3 avg ext and Uroplak avg ext= basal
- CK5/6 avg ext and CD44 avg ext < CK20 avg ext and Gata3 avg ext and Uroplak avg ext= luminal
- The ones that don’t fit =  Non Classifiable
Then we can compare prognostics (rec and progression ) based on this simple classifier of three groups


GJNETTO:
Cd44 ck5/6 positivity favor basal while gata3/uroplkn/er/her2 favor luminal 
Use mean spots extent -ignore pattern for now - and bin into three groups
Basal if average of either basal markers is higher than the luminal group
Luminal if average ext of any luminal marker s is higher the two basal ones.
